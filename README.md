# Mid-Bootcamp-Project 2023

- In this project i did some comparison analysis from 2000 to 2022 of countries like:
- Portugal
- Spain
- Ireland
- Greece

With some data figures:
- Debt-to-GDP
- Inflation Rate
- Unemployment Rate
- Interest Rate

# Hint: 
"I could be doing the PIGS Countries (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain),
 but i choose Ireland due to his amazing performance through the years
 in terms of debt-to-gdp and other reductions compare to Italy!"

### Process #1 - Data Visualization, Selection & Modelling in Python.

- Gathering some data from "World Bank open data" to a excel file
- Format the excel file for a .csv file to start working on the dataset
- Data Cleaning and preprocessing
- Attribute Selection
- Save Clean Data into a .csv file for Tableau Visualizations
- Prediction Modelling using some of the methods we've learn so far

### Process #2 - Tableau Visualizations.

- Export the "Clean Data" .csv file into tableau to start the visualizations
- Creating Several Dashboard's to present and explain some Comparing Analysis
- After further Visualization, setup how do you gonna present your Dashboards

### Process #3 - Tableau Presentation Link.

- Here the link of the Presentation:
